# Simple Teaching Assistant

## Why?

The Simple Teaching Assistant helps teaching programming.
Our students will become engineers, so we chose `C` as language.
But there is an allure to projects like [Processing](https://processing.org/), which teach programming a little more visual – and a little less black matrix.

The Simple Teaching Assistant takes the edge off of _graphical_ programming by providing a ready-made environment.
The provided framework lets the student easily create graphical solutions and compile them.
The framework offers a set of drawing functions and a `setup`/`draw` structure similar to [Processing's](https://processing.org/examples/loop.html).
It is based on [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

**Why write a wrapper around SDL?**
First semester students typically don't know about double buffering, window handles or texture rendering.
The thin wrapper removes the need for explaining such things and arms the students with tools to solve (visual) problems.
We – teachers – can focus on explaining the stuff that really counts: problem solving.

## Prerequisites

**On Mac**, you can install the prerequisites via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):  `brew install git sdl2 sdl2_gfx sdl2_ttf`.

**On Linux** (Ubuntu), I installed the following packages: `sudo apt-get -y install git build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`.

Or do it **without a package manager** and follow the instructions on these respective sites: [git](https://git-scm.com/), [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [SDL GFX](http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx).

For offline usage (one student always has problems with wifi), it is highly encouraged to check out a local copy of the repository.
To do so, please go to:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/motine/sta.git /usr/local/sta.git
# later the teacher can halp and start a new project from the local repo:
# => git clone /usr/local/sta.git myproject
```

If you want to update a the local repository or an existing project you can run `git pull` in the respective folder.

## Get started

We create a new project with:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/motine/sta.git myproject # Creates a new folder: ~/Documents/myproject and copies the framework
```

The most important file is named `project.c`. This is where the student puts his/her solution. It starts off looking something like this:

```c
#include "sketchbook.h"

void setup() {
  // do initialization here
}

void draw() {
  // this will be repeated on and on and on...
  rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
}
```

Now, we compile and run:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/myproject # let's not forget that we have to go to the project first
make # runs gcc with all the -I and -l options and writes the executable to 'project'
# ... output of GCC ...
./project # opens a window and shows a rectangle
```

If this all works fine and dandy, we can start changing our `setup` and `draw` methods.

# Sketchbook

The framework, which is used by including `sketchbook.h`, provides a `main` function.
By default, it brings up a 800 x 600 px wide window.

![Coordinate system](sta/imgs/coor.png)

It calls the `setup` method once before the drawing starts. It can be used to do initialization.

To see something on the screen, we need to write a `draw` method.
This method is called 25 times a second (if the computer is fast enough).
All drawing code is executed and the final picture is put on the screen right after the method has finished.
It is highly discouraged to use delay or similar functions in the `draw` method.
This interferes with keyboard, mouse and other handlers.

## Overview / API

_For simplicity all types like `uint8_t` have been replaced with common standard types like `unsigned short`. The actual function definition in the header file may differ_

**Program flow**

```c
// Called once before the calls to `draw` start.
void setup(); // !! This method must be provided by the student (in the `project.c` file).
// This method is called over and over again.
// Right before the screen is emtied, right after all the drawing is put on the screen. 
void draw(); // !! This method must be provided by the student (in the `project.c` file)

// Stop the calls to `draw`. The result of the current `draw` will be kept on the screen forever.
void stop();
// Terminate the application after the current `draw`.
void quit();
```

**Drawing**

```c
// Get the window's dimensions
WIDTH
HEIGHT

// Set fill color for drawing future shapes.
void fill(unsigned short r, unsigned short g, unsigned short b);
// Disable filling shapes.
void no_fill();
// Set stroke color for drawing future shapes.
void stroke(unsigned short r, unsigned short g, unsigned short b);
// Disable stroking future shapes.
void no_stroke();

// Draws a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) with the stroke color.
void line(unsigned int x1, unsigned int y1, unsigned int x2, unsigned int y2);
// Draws a rectangle from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).
void rectangle(unsigned int x1, unsigned int y1, unsigned int x2, unsigned int y2);
// Draws an ellipse around (x, y) with the radius of rx and ry.
void ellipse(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int rx, unsigned int ry);
// Draws a circle with its midpoint at (x, y) and radius r.
void circle(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int r);
// Draws a pie piece around the midpoint (x,y) and radius r. Start and end angle are given in degrees
void pie(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int r, unsigned int start, unsigned int end);
// Sets the given pixel to the stroke color.
void pixel(unsigned int x, unsigned int y);

// Draws the given text at (x,y), using the stroke color.
void text(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, const char* text);

// Set the background color. It is used to clear the screen before each `draw()` call.
void background(unsigned short r, unsigned short g, unsigned short b);
```
  
**Input**
  
```c
// Returns the current x mouse cooridinate.
unsigned int mouse_x();
// Returns the current y mouse cooridinate.
unsigned int mouse_y();
// Returns true if the left mouse button is pressed.
bool mouse_pressed();

// Returns true if the given key is pressed.
// Valid keys are found in the "SDL_Scancode Value" column of this table: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode
// Be aware: The ESC key is handled by the framework itself and will quit the application.
bool key_pressed(unsigned short key);
```

**Timeline**

```c
// Returns the number of milliseconds passed since the program started.
unsigned long long millis();

// Returns the number of the frame which is currently drawn.
// The result of the first draw method has frame index 0, the next 1, ...
unsigned long long frame_index();
```

**Useful stuff from other libraries**

```c
// Sketchbook includes `stdbool.h`. It defines the type
bool // and the values
false	// as 0
true	// as 1

// Returns a pseudo-random number between ​0​ and the highest positive number of int.
int rand(); // You don't need to worrie about calling srand(). Sketchbook does it automatically for you.

// Sketchbook includes the `math.h` library. Please see the API here: http://devdocs.io/c/numeric/math
double fabs(double x); // All sorts of trigonometric functions
double sin(double x);
double cos(double x);
double tan(double x);
M_PI // And the value of PI

// Sketchbook also includes the whole `SDL.h` library with `SDL2_gfxPrimitives.h`. Please refrain from using the methods directly though.
// It also uses `stdint.h` in its headers.
```

## Examples

### Sketching functions

![](sta/imgs/funs.png)

```c
#include "sketchbook.h"

void setup() {
  // do initialization here
}

void draw() {
  // this will be repeated on and on and on...
  rectangle(10, 10, 200, 200);
  line(10, 20, 40, 10);
  ellipse(150, 60, 30, 20);
  circle(80, 150, 20);
  pie(60, 50, 30, 30, 180);
  pixel(100, 100);
  text(100, 100, "draw!");
}
```

### Frame rate

![](sta/imgs/fps.png)

The drawing sketchbook will ensure that there is a frame rate of 50 frames per second (if the computer is fast enough).
This ensures we have a near constant time between frames and the frame duration does not vary much (e.g. because of processors load).

```c
// ...
static int i = 0;
void draw() {
  rectangle(i % 100, 10, 100, 100);
  i++;
}
```

### Mouse & Keyboard

![](sta/imgs/mouse.png)

For the sake of simplicity, there is no event listeners or event polling.
Yet, there are functions to ask for the current mouse position and check which key is currently pressed.
_Limitation: We can only recognizing a single key at any given time._

```c
// ...
void draw() {
  rectangle(10, 10, mouse_x(), mouse_y());
}
```

![](sta/imgs/buttons.png)

Handling buttons and keys is done like this:

```c
// ...
void draw() {
  if (mouse_pressed()) { // checks if the left mouse button is pressed
    stroke(255, 0, 0);
  } else {
    stroke(200, 200, 200);
  }
  
  if (key_pressed(SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN)) { // checks if the enter key is pressed
    fill(255, 0, 0);
  } else {
    fill(255, 255, 255);
  }
  
  rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);
}
```


### Coloring

![](sta/imgs/color.png)

_These are the worst colors a human ever chose..._

```c
#include "sketchbook.h"

void setup() {
  // do initialization here
}

void draw() {
  stroke(255, 0, 0); // apply stroke for all subsequent shapes
  line(10, 20, 40, 10); // appears red

  fill(0, 255, 0); // apply fill for all following shapes
  rectangle(10, 10, 150, 150); // has a green background and still red stroke

  stroke(0, 0, 255);
  no_fill(); // disable filling
  circle(50, 50, 20); // appears with blue stroke and not no fill

  no_stroke(); // disable stroking
  circle(10, 10, 10); // this is invisible
  
  stroke(0, 0, 0);
  pixel(100, 100); // adds three black pixels
  pixel(102, 100);
  pixel(104, 100);
}
```

# Internals

**Vagrant**
For testing the environment of the students I am using a vagrant machine.
To start the minimalistic window manager please run `sudo startxfce4` in the GUI.
For the full blown gnome run `sudo startx`.

## Disclaimer

I am aware that some of the choices I made are quite opinionated.
Two examples are: I am providing a main function in a module (ugh) and I am using 50 fps and not a decent time difference method.
These two choices – and many others – were made because I think they make teaching simpler.
I guess these simplifications should considered carefully for a real world project.
